    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Kashish Bhardwaj</strong>, a passionate and curious student pursuing a degree in Computer Science. 
    I'm deeply interested in <strong>Data Science</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, and <strong>Web Development</strong>, and I love solving real-world problems using code.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've completed internships and built projects that helped me strengthen my skills in <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. 
    Recently, I worked on exciting projects like a <em>Netflix clone</em> and a <em>Smart parking System</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was also a trainee at IIT Mandi iHub and HCI Foundation where I was enhancing my AI and data quality assurance skills. 
    I enjoyed learning new tools, building cool things, and always improving myself.
  </p>
